Please read #/docs/FIX_APPLIED_SUMMARY.md and apply all the code changes documented in it to my project. This file contains:

- Updates to add folder structure preservation in PDF processing
- Changes to JavaScript, Python, and Java Lambda functions
- Updates to ECS container code

For each section in the file, apply the "AFTER" code changes to the corresponding files. Skip any sections marked as "Debug" or "Investigation" unless they're needed. After making all changes, show me the git commands to commit and deploy.
